# Ideas
> You can try to run this project through the following commands until the docker-compose file is published, and see how it works.
> In the frontend folder:
```
npm run serve
```
> In the backend folder:
```
python3 manage.py runserver
```
> Also you need to create a database in postgres. You can find settings at settings.py file in ideas folder.
> In the end, you also have to run redis image to make the chat work via websockets.
> Soon I will launch this service on the server and attach the link below. Expect it!
